software plans
Initial - 3D image
in python run a thing that 
turns into array with x y z cords
plan is to split cave into a lot of different plots, each with dimensions and zoom percentage
then with the buttons figure out where to go

Plans for next week
plan for SD for terminal

one cave at a time

computer - python - array - code for LED lighting

spi interface for stm32
I2C interface is better maybe if it works

computer - 3D image - python - arrays - 60 images of that plugged into USB with a lot of different images, (the loading is the slowest part so it shoudlnt' be an issue) which is for different options including zoom and movement - USB to stm32 - stm32 then would register the button press and change the pictures accordingly
